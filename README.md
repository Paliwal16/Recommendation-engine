Movie recommendation system created for Movielens Datset

## Context

GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set.
A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly.

Inspiration

Can you make a movie recommender system using any type of recommedation algorithms like content based, collaborative filtering etc?

### I've made Recommendation Engine using Content Based Filtering algorithm which provides me great insights about the data.
